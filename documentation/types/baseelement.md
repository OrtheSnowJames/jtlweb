# Base element

Almost every element, under the hood has a base element. This element has x, y, width, height and other basic stuff. Not recommended for actual use, as will not actually render, just take up a lot of space.

I'm not going to show you an example of this because I'm pretty sure it doesn't work.

Styles:
    width: Stretches the element on the width in px. EX: `width: 50;`
    height: Stretches the element on the height in px. EX: `height: 50;`
    color: Sets the color of the element in rgba (red, green, blue, alpha). EX: `color: 0, 0, 0, 255`
    border-color: Sets the border color of the element in rgba (red, green, blue, alpha). EX: `border-color: 0, 0, 0, 255`
    font-family: Selects a font to use for displaying. Read avalible fonts in documentation/fonts.txt. EX: `font-family: JetBrainsMono;`
